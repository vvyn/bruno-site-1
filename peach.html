        <p>Quite an excellent taste. I do enjoy the flavor in the first bite. I do not get sick of it after eating the entire peach which is how a fruit and any food should be. I do take a star off though for the messiness of the juice. Not a fan of the cleaning up after eating the delicious fruit.</p>
